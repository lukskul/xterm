## Terminal using xterm

JavaScript code is added to html for a quick test of the xterm.  

## Ideas

I would like to implament a terminal for the lukskul.nft website.  
There are also a few parts of this terminal referencing the 1993 movie Jurassic park.  

## How to run this project: 
install dependencies: In the terminal run the command -  

    1. npm install @xterm/xterm
