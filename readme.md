## Terminal using xterm

JavaScript code is added to html for a quick test of the xterm.  Comments leave on for demo.  

## Idea:

I would like to implament a terminal for the lukskul.nft website.  
There are also a few parts of this terminal referencing the 1993 movie Jurassic park. 

## ToDo: 

Build out a larger project seperating the javascript and running a dev server.

## How to run this project:
